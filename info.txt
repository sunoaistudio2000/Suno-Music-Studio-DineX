[Intro: Melodic and atmospheric building intensity]

[Verse 1]
Dark clouds were heavy, blocking out the sun
Thought the race was over before it even begun
But a spark in the ashes started to glow
I found a strength I didn't even know

[Chorus: Energetic and uplifting]
I’m rising up, I’m breaking the chain
Finding the sunlight inside of the rain
Every stumble was a lesson to learn
Watch as the tables finally turn

[Instrumental Break: Emotional electric guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
The mountain was steep, the valley was wide
But I carried the fire burning inside
No more looking back at the shadows behind
A brand new horizon is all that I find

[Chorus]
I’m rising up, I’m breaking the chain
Finding the sunlight inside of the rain
Every stumble was a lesson to learn
Watch as the tables finally turn

[Bridge: Stripped back, soft piano and building drums]
It wasn't easy, it wasn't fast
But the shadows of yesterday are in the past
(Building energy...)

[Guitar Solo: Intense and soaring]

[Final Chorus: Maximum energy, layered vocals]
I’m rising up, I’m breaking the chain
Finding the sunlight inside of the rain!

[Outro: Fading out with a steady beat]
Rising up... 
Breaking through...
[End]
