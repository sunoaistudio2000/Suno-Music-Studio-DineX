Title: Midnight Echo
Prompt:

[Intro: Bright digital synth brass and a driving 125BPM disco beat]
[Spoken: Smooth, deep charismatic voice]
Love is a game... and we play by the rules of the heart.

[Verse 1: Deep, breathy male vocals with high-pitched background echoes]
I'm sailing on a sea of blue (Sea of blue)
Searching for a heart that’s true (Heart that’s true)
The night is young, the moon is bright (Moon is bright)
I’m holding on with all my might (All my might)
Oh, can't you see the fire in my eyes? (In my eyes)
Underneath the lonely starlit skies! (Starlit skies)

[Chorus: High-pitched multi-layered falsetto, very melodic]
It’s a symphony of love, it’s a rhythm in the night
Everything’s okay, everything’s alright
You’re the lady of my dreams, you’re the angel in my soul
Take my heart away, let me lose control!

[Verse 2: Deep baritone with falsetto response]
A lonely room, a silent phone (Silent phone)
I’m sitting here all on my own (On my own)
I hear your ghost walk down the hall (Down the hall)
I see your shadow on the wall (On the wall)
But baby, time will never change my mind (Change my mind)
You’re the only girl I’ll ever find! (Ever find)

[Instrumental Solo: Melodic synthesizer lead and bright disco bells]

[Bridge: Dramatic synth pads and building percussion]
(Deep voice)
Don't walk away...
(High falsetto)
Don't break my heart!
(Shouted)
LADY!

[Final Chorus: Maximum energy, layered falsetto harmonies]
It’s a symphony of love, it’s a rhythm in the night
Everything’s okay, everything’s alright
You’re the lady of my dreams, you’re the angel in my soul
Take my heart away, let me lose control!

[Outro: Fading disco beat with falsetto echoes]
Symphony of love... (Of love)
Angel in my soul... (My soul)
[End]
