Title: Shatter the Silence

Prompt:

[Intro: Heavy distorted guitar riff, fast drum fill]

[Verse 1: Gritty, lower-register vocals]
Counting the seconds in this empty room
Waiting for the spark to ignite the gloom
They told me to stay, told me to wait my turn
But I’ve got a fire that’s starting to burn
Yeah, the walls are thin and the floor is cold
I’m breaking the script that was already told!

[Pre-Chorus: Building energy, rising pitch]
Can you feel the tension? 
Can you hear the sound?
Of a thousand heartbeats
Rising from the ground!

[Chorus: Powerful belted vocals, anthemic]
Shatter the silence, tear down the sky!
I’m finding my wings, I’m learning to fly!
No more excuses, no more "maybe next time"
I’m claiming the mountain, I’m starting the climb!
(Yeah, I’m starting the climb!)

[Verse 2: Driving rhythm, punchy delivery]
The static is screaming inside of my head
Drowning out everything everyone said
I’m making a path through the wreckage and dust
Turning the iron away from the rust
The engine is humming, the gears are in place
I’m looking the future right in the face!

[Chorus: Powerful belted vocals]
Shatter the silence, tear down the sky!
I’m finding my wings, I’m learning to fly!
No more excuses, no more "maybe next time"
I’m claiming the mountain, I’m starting the climb!

[Bridge: Stripped back, then building]
[Bass solo]
In the quiet...
In the dark...
[Crescendo]
I FOUND THE SPARK!

[Guitar Solo: Fast, melodic, heavy wah-wah effect]

[Final Chorus: Maximum energy, vocal ad-libs]
SHATTER THE SILENCE! (Tear it down!)
Finding my wings! (Watch me fly!)
No more excuses, this is my time
I’m at the top of the world and the view is sublime!

[Outro: Fading guitar feedback, heavy final drum hit]
I’m not coming down...
No...
[End]
