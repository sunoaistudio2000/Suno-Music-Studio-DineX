Title: Neon Wasteland

Prompt:

[Intro: Pulsing heavy synthesizer bass, flickering glitch percussion, and cold metallic drone]
[Spoken: Distant, echoing voice with slight bit-crushed effect]
System check... initiated.
The city never sleeps... it just waits for the crash.

[Verse 1: Low, breathy rhythmic delivery, robotic but emotive]
The static is screaming, I’m chasing the ghost in the wire
The circuit is dreaming, igniting the spark of the fire
I’m lost in the chrome, where the signals are starting to bleed
A digital home, for a soul with a desperate need
The skyline is jagged, I’m crossing the edge of the light
The shadows are ragged, dissolving inside of the night
I’m hacking the pulse, of a world that is made out of glass
The future is false, just watching the centuries pass!

[Chorus: Explosive and wide, layered synth-stacks and driving electronic beat]
We’re burning the code, carrying the weight of the machine
Surviving the road, in a world that’s forgotten the green
They want to erase us, want to see the memory fade
But the data is deep, we’re the masters of all we have made!

[Verse 2: High-tension delivery, building with distorted layers]
I hear the sirens calling, through the rain and the neon haze
The towers are falling, lost in a vertical maze
I’m cleaning the drive, of a thousand corrupted files
Just staying alive, across the electric miles
The network is flowing, even when the power is low
The signal is growing, nowhere left for the losers to go
I don’t need the binary, I don’t need the zero or one
I’m finding the truth, before the reboot is done!

[Instrumental Solo: Screeching synth lead, heavy distorted bass rhythm, and mechanical industrial claps]

[Bridge: Minimalist breakdown, heartbeat kick drum and sweeping filter effects]
(Whispered voice)
They said the grid was locked... and the exit was deleted...
(Building intensely)
But we found the breach... where the system was defeated!
(Shouted)
OVERRIDE! BREAK THE CORE!

[Final Chorus: Maximum energy, soaring synth leads, heavy wall of sound]
We’re burning the code, carrying the weight of the machine
Surviving the road, in a world that’s forgotten the green
They want to erase us, want to see the memory fade
But the data is deep, we’re the masters of all we have made!

[Outro: Glitchy fading vocals, cold digital decay]
Transmission...
Connection...
Lost in the stream...
[End]
[Fade out with white noise]
