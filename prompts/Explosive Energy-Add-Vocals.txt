Title: Explosive Energy

Prompt:

[Verse 1 - Male, Raspy Rock Vocals]
In the static of the night, I see the fire rise,
Burning down the shadows, breaking all the ties.

[Verse 2 - Female, Melodic Power Vocals]
Caught within the echo, reaching for the spark,
We are more than ghosts just dancing in the dark.

[Chorus - Both, Powerful Harmonies]
Explosive energy, it’s tearing through the soul,
Two hearts colliding now, we’re losing all control!
