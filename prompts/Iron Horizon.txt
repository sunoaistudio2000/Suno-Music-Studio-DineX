Title:  Iron Horizon

Prompt:

[Intro: Fast harmonized guitar riffs, explosive double-bass drumming]

[Verse 1: **Gritty Male Vocals**]
The sky is turning to a wall of lead
The words of prophets that we never read
We're walking lines on a jagged blade
In the ruins of the world we made!

[Verse 2: **Clean Female Vocals - Soaring**]
But there’s a flicker in the iron dark
A frozen engine waiting for a spark
I see the future in a drop of rain
We’re breaking free from the electric chain!

[Pre-Chorus: **Both - Building Tension**]
The gears are turning, the blood is burning
The pressure rising till we break the core!

[Chorus: **Both - Anthemic Harmonies**]
On the Iron Horizon, we’re chasing the sun
The battle is starting, but never is done
With hearts made of thunder and spirits of steel
We’re crushing the shadows under the wheel!

[Instrumental Solo: Fast shredding guitar solo, sweep picking, technical drum fills]

[Bridge: **Call and Response**]
[**Male**]: No more surrender!
[**Female**]: No more retreat!
[**Male**]: We find our glory...
[**Female**]: ...In every defeat!
[**Both - Shouted**]: LIGHT THE FIRE!

[Final Chorus: **Both - Maximum Power**]
On the Iron Horizon, we’re chasing the sun
The battle is starting, but never is done
With hearts made of thunder and spirits of steel
We’re crushing the shadows under the wheel!

[Outro: Heavy rhythmic chugging, fading guitar feedback]
[**Male**]: The horizon...
[**Female**]: ...is ours.
