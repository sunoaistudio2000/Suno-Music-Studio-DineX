Title:  Eternal Echoes

Prompt:

[Intro: Soft felt piano with a low, mourning cello drone]
[**Spoken: Male voice, distant echo**]
The clock has stopped... but the resonance remains.

[Verse 1: **Male Singer**]
The ivory is weeping, I’m tracing the dust on the keys
The memory is keeping, the secrets that fall to their knees
I’m lost in the stone, where the shadows are starting to play
A kingdom of bone, for a soul that has withered away

[Verse 2: **Female Singer**]
The marble is cold, I’m crossing the floor of the past
The stories untold, are the ones that were destined to last
I’m feeling the pulse, of a heart that is made out of rain
The silence is false, just a mask for the weight of the pain!

[Chorus: **Both, Vocal Harmonies**]
We’re carrying the weight, of a world that is frozen in time
Defying our fate, in a ritual dark and sublime
They want to erase us, want to see the melody end
But the music is deep, on a grace that we cannot defend!

[Instrumental Solo: Emotional violin solo, weeping cello counterpoint]

[Bridge: **Call and Response**]
[**Male**]: They said the door was barred...
[**Female**]: And the song was finished...
[**Male**]: But we found the spark...
[**Female**]: Where the fire was never diminished!
[**Both, Shouted/Operatic**]: RESONATE! BREAK THE VOID!

[Final Chorus: **Both, Maximum Energy, Soaring Strings**]
We’re carrying the weight, of a world that is frozen in time
Defying our fate, in a ritual dark and sublime
They want to erase us, want to see the melody end
But the music is deep, on a grace that we cannot defend!

[Outro: Fading piano notes, cold orchestral decay]
[**Whisper: Both**]
Resonance... fading...
[End]
