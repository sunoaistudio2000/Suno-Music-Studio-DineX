Title: Redemption Enlivening Euphoric Opera Mix

Prompt:
[Intro]
(Atmospheric pads, distant operatic hum, building 128 BPM pulse)

[Verse 1: Airy Operatic Vocal]
Walking the line where the shadows meet the light
A soul in suspension, lost in the night
Every step is a whisper of what used to be
Searching for the road that will set the spirit free

[Build-up: Rising Synth Energy]
[Energy: Rising]
The rhythm is waking, the pulse starts to beat
(Enlivening... Enlivening...)

[Chorus: Power Soprano over Dance Beat]
[Energy: High]
On the Redemption Road, we rise through the flame
Enlivening the heart, we're never the same
Break through the silence, let the anthem soar
We aren't lost in the echoes anymore!

[Verse 2: Staccato Electronic Vocal Style]
Now the colors are bleeding through the grey
The gravity of yesterday is falling away
From the silence of stones to the thunder of stars
We’re healing the wounds and we’re wearing the scars

[Bridge: Dramatic Orchestral Breakdown]
[Tempo: Half-time]
(Deep operatic chant)
Gloria... In Excelsis...
(Beat stops, sudden silence)
[Pause]
[Energy: Exploding]
NOW!

[Chorus: Maximum Power]
On the Redemption Road, we rise through the flame
Enlivening the heart, we're never the same
Break through the silence, let the anthem soar
We aren't lost in the echoes anymore!

[Outro: Progressive House Melodies]
Redemption...
Enlivening...
(Fading out with a final operatic high note)
[End]
