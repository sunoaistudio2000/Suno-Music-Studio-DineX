#### 🚀 Web-Based Suno Music Studio: Advanced Track Generation with Custom Settings

This project demonstrates a web-based AI music studio powered by Suno and integrated via the kie.ai API. Users can generate instrumental or vocal tracks using Simple or Custom modes, controlling parameters like Style Weight, Weirdness, and Audio Weight. Tracks can include duets, hard rock, metal, piano meditation, or bilingual reggae, with multiple variations generated per request.

The app manages tracks with MongoDB and server-hosted audio files, supports search and deletion, and handles callbacks, debugging, and error management for reliable AI-driven music generation.

We are going to add more features later, including a web-based music app that will allow users to generate, extend, and customize music, create personas, produce covers, generate music videos, and manage tracks with advanced creative controls. A dashboard will let users organize and share their creations.

#### 🎤 Generating Persona
We implemented persona generation in [kie.ai](https://kie.ai/)  to give vocal tracks a unique musical identity. A persona defines the performer’s voice, tone, emotion, and delivery, as well as the overall style, mood, and instrumentation. Personas allow you to generate new tracks that feel like they belong to the same musical world, even if the vocals differ. Only vocal tracks can be used to create a persona, and each persona can be saved, edited, and reused for consistent music generation.

#### 🎶 Extending Music
We implemented music extension in [kie.ai](https://kie.ai/) to allow generated tracks to continue beyond their original length or evolve creatively. Extensions preserve the core genre, tempo, and musical identity while introducing new sections, arrangements, or energy. By using Custom Parameters, you can modify style, weights, and other settings for creative variation, or keep them off for a seamless continuation of the original track. Each extension can be generated as a separate track or physically appended to the original for a cohesive listening experience.
 
#### 🎶 Upload & Extend Music
We’ve added a new feature that lets you upload your own MP3 tracks and extend them directly from the server. The process uses an upload step followed by an extend step, with files hosted temporarily on the [kie.ai](https://kie.ai/)  server. This is especially useful for tracks that may no longer exist on the main server after 14 days, as your uploaded files remain accessible for extension unless manually deleted. By adjusting prompt, style, and weights, you can create creative extensions while keeping the core identity of your track intact.

#### 🎶 Upload & Cover Music
We’ve added a new feature that lets you upload your own MP3 tracks and cover them in a new style directly on the server. The process uses an upload step followed by a cover step, with files hosted temporarily on the [kie.ai](https://kie.ai/) server. Even if you modify the prompt and adjust the style, the cover preserves the track’s original melody and musical “DNA,” keeping its core identity intact while creating a fresh, stylistically transformed version.

#### 🎶 Add Instrumental
The Add Instrumental feature lets you transform your uploaded vocal or melody into a full instrumental track. Simply upload your MP3 vocal or melody, then set the title, tags, and weights to customize the result. The generated instrumental is created directly on the server, allowing you to instantly listen to the transformation. This is perfect for experimenting with new arrangements, remixing ideas, or quickly producing professional-sounding tracks without needing a producer.
