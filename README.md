#### 🚀 Web-Based Suno Music Studio: Advanced Track Generation with Custom Settings

This project demonstrates a web-based AI music studio powered by Suno and integrated via the kie.ai API. Users can generate instrumental or vocal tracks using Simple or Custom modes, controlling parameters like Style Weight, Weirdness, and Audio Weight. Tracks can include duets, hard rock, metal, piano meditation, or bilingual reggae, with multiple variations generated per request.

The app manages tracks with MongoDB and server-hosted audio files, supports search and deletion, and handles callbacks, debugging, and error management for reliable AI-driven music generation.

We are going to add more features later, including a web-based music app that will allow users to generate, extend, and customize music, create personas, produce covers, generate music videos, and manage tracks with advanced creative controls. A dashboard will let users organize and share their creations.

#### 🎤 Generating Persona
We implemented persona generation in [kie.ai](https://kie.ai/)  to give vocal tracks a unique musical identity. A persona defines the performer’s voice, tone, emotion, and delivery, as well as the overall style, mood, and instrumentation. Personas allow you to generate new tracks that feel like they belong to the same musical world, even if the vocals differ. Only vocal tracks can be used to create a persona, and each persona can be saved, edited, and reused for consistent music generation.

#### 🎶 Extending Music
We implemented music extension in [kie.ai](https://kie.ai/) to allow generated tracks to continue beyond their original length or evolve creatively. Extensions preserve the core genre, tempo, and musical identity while introducing new sections, arrangements, or energy. By using Custom Parameters, you can modify style, weights, and other settings for creative variation, or keep them off for a seamless continuation of the original track. Each extension can be generated as a separate track or physically appended to the original for a cohesive listening experience.
